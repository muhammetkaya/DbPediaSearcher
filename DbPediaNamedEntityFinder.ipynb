When Peteanswered, his phone turned the sound down by sending a message to all the other local devices that had a volume control. His sister, Lucy, was on the line from the doctor's office: \"Mom needs to see a specialist and then has to have a series of physical therapy sessions. Biweekly or something. I'm going to have my agent setup the appointments.\" Pete immediately agreed to share the chauffeuring.At the doctor's office, Lucy instructed her Semantic Web agent through her handheld Web browser. The agent promptly retrieved information about Mom's prescribed treatment from the doctor's agent, looked up several lists of providers, and checked for the ones in-plan for Mom's insurance within a 20-mile radius of her home and with a rating of excellent or very good on trusted rating services. It then began trying to find a match between available appointment times (supplied by the agents of individual providers through their Web sites) and Pete's and Lucy's busy schedules. (The emphasized keywords indicate terms whose semantics, or meaning, were defined for the agent through the Semantic Web.)In a few minutes the agent presented them with a plan. Pete didn't likeitŠUniversity Hospital was all the way across town from Mom's place, andhe'd be driving back in the middle of rush hour. He set his own agent toredo the search with stricter preferences about location and time. Lucy's agent, having complete trust in Pete's agent in the context of the present task, automatically assisted by supplying access certificates and shortcuts to the data it had already sorted through.Almost instantly the new plan was presented: a much closer clinic and earlier timesŠbut there were twowarning notes. First, Pete would have to reschedule a couple of his less important appointments. He checkedwhat they wereŠnot a problem. The other was something about the insurance company's list failing to include this provider under physical therapists: \"Service type and insurance plan status securely verified by other means,\" the agent reassured him. \"(Details?)\"Lucy registered her assent at about the same moment Pete was muttering, \"Spare me the details,\" and it was all set. (Of course, Pete couldn't resist the details and later that night had his agent explain how it had found that provider even though it wasn't on the proper list.)Expressing MeaningPete and Lucy could use their agents to carry out all these tasks thanks not to the World Wide Web of today but rather the Semantic Web that it will evolve into tomorrow. Most of the Web's content today isdesigned for humans to read, not for computer programs to manipulate meaningfully. Computers can adeptly parse Web pages for layout and routine processingŠhere a header, there a link to anotherpageŠbut in general, computers have no reliable way to process the semantics: this is the home page of the Hartman and Strauss Physio Clinic, this link goes to Dr. Hartman's curriculum vitae.The Semantic Web will bring structure to the meaningful content of Web pages, creating an environment where software agents roaming from page to page can readily carry out sophisticated tasks for users. Such an agent coming to the clinic's Web page will know not just that the page has keywords such as \"treatment, medicine, physical, therapy\" (as might be encoded today) but also that Dr. Hartman works at this clinic on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and that the script takes a date range in yyyy-mm-dd format and returns appointment times. And it will \"know\" all this without needing artificial intelligence on the scale of 2001's Hal or Star Wars's C-3PO. Instead these semantics were encoded into the Web page when the clinic's office manager (who never took Comp Sci 101) massaged it into shape using off-the-shelf software for writing Semantic Web pages along with resources listed on the Physical Therapy Association's site.The Semantic Web is not a separate Web but an extension of the current one, in which information is given well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation. The first steps in weaving the Semantic Web into the structure of the existing Web are already under way. In the near future, these developments will usher in significant new functionality as machines become much better able to process and \"understand\" the data that they merely display at present.The essential property of the World Wide Web is its universality. The power of a hypertext link is that \"anything can link to anything.\" Web technology, therefore, must not discriminate between the scribbled draft and the polished performance, between commercial and academic information, or among cultures, languages, media and so on. Information varies along many axes. One of these is the difference between information produced primarily for human consumption and that produced mainly for machines. At one end of the scale we have everything from the five-second TV commercial to poetry. At the other end we have databases, programs and sensor output. To date, the Web has developed most rapidly as a medium of documents for people rather than for data and information that can be processed automatically. The Semantic Web aims to make up for this.Like the Internet, the Semantic Web will be as decentralized as possible. Such Web-like systems generate a lot of excitement at every level, from major corporation to individual user, and provide benefits that are hard or impossible to predict in advance. Decentralization requires compromises: the Web had to throw away the ideal of total consistency of all of its interconnections, ushering in the infamous message \"Error 404: Not Found\" but allowing unchecked exponential growth.Knowledge RepresentationFor the semantic web to function, computers must have access to structured collections of information and sets of inference rules that they can use to conduct automated reasoning. Artificial-intelligence researchers have studied such systems since long before the Web was developed. Knowledge representation, as this technology is often called, is currently in a state comparable to that of hypertext before the advent of the Web: it is clearly a good idea, and some very nice demonstrations exist, but it has not yet changed the world. It contains the seeds of important applications, but to realize its full potential it\n",
            "must be linked into a single global system.Traditional knowledge-representation systems typically have been centralized, requiring everyone to share exactly the same definition of common concepts such as \"parent\" or \"vehicle.\" But central control is stifling, and increasing the size and scope of such a system rapidly becomes unmanageable.Moreover, these systems usually carefully limit the questions that can be asked so that the computer can answer reliablyŠ or answer at all. The problem isreminiscent of Gödel's theorem from mathematics: any system that is complex enough to be useful also encompasses unanswerable questions, much likesophisticated versions of the basic paradox \"This sentence is false.\" To avoid such problems, traditional knowledge-representation systems generally each had theirown narrow and idiosyncratic set of rules for making inferences about their data. For example, a genealogy system, acting on a database of family trees, might includethe rule \"a wife of an uncle is an aunt.\" Even if the data could be transferred from one system to another, the rules, existing in a completely different form, usually could\n",
            "not.Semantic Web researchers, in contrast, accept that paradoxes and unanswerable questions are a price that must be paid to achieve versatility. We make the language for the rules as expressive as needed to allow the Web to reason as widely as desired. This philosophy is similar to that of the conventional Web: early in the Web's development, detractors pointed out that it could never be a well-organized library; without a central database and tree structure, one would never be sure of \n",
            "finding everything. They were right. But the expressive power of the system made vast amounts of information available, and search engines (which would have seemed quite impractical a decade ago) now produce remarkably complete indices of a lot of the material out there. The challenge of the Semantic Web, therefore, isto provide a language that expresses both data and rules for reasoning about the data and that allows rules from any existing knowledge-representation system to be exported onto the Web.Adding logic to the WebŠthe means to use rules to make inferences, choose courses of action and answer questionsŠis the task before the Semantic Web community at the moment. A mixture ofmathematical and engineering decisions complicate this task. The logic must be powerful enough to describe complex properties of objects but not so powerful that agents can be tricked by being asked toconsider a paradox. Fortunately, a large majority of the information we want to express is along the lines of \"a hex-head bolt is a type of machine bolt,\" which is readily written in existing languages with a littleextra vocabulary.Two important technologies for developing the Semantic Web are already in place: eXtensible Markup Language (XML) and the Resource Description Framework (RDF). XML lets everyone create their owntagsŠhidden labels such as or that annotate Web pages or sections of text on a page. Scripts, or programs, can make use of these tags in sophisticated ways, but the script writer has to know what the page writer uses each tag for. In short, XML allows users to add arbitrary structure to their documents but says nothing about what the structures mean.Meaning is expressed by RDF, which encodes it in sets of triples, each triple being rather like the subject, verb and object of an elementary sentence. These triples can be written using XML tags. In RDF, a document makes assertions that particular things (people, Web pages or \n",

It often requires a hit to an unoccupied part of the ballpark (as in an opposite-field hit) or the ball taking an unusual bounce in the outfield.\", 'Classes': []}, 'triple': {'Count': 1, 'Label': 'Music recording sales certification', 'Uri': 'http://dbpedia.org/resource/Music_recording_sales_certification', 'Description': 'Music recording sales certification is a system of certifying that a music recording has shipped or sold a certain number of copies, where the threshold quantity varies by type and by nation or territory.
